# Issue Summary

## Duration of Outage
The outage lasted for approximately 2 hours, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM (UTC).

## Impact
The Nginx web server was completely down during this period, resulting in a 100% outage for all web services hosted on the server. Users attempting to access websites hosted on the server experienced connection errors and were unable to load any content.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was a combination of the Nginx server not being started and a typographical error in the server configuration file.

# Timeline

10:00 AM (UTC): Issue detected when a system administrator received reports of websites hosted on the server being inaccessible.

10:05 AM (UTC): The administrator attempted to access the websites and encountered connection errors.

10:10 AM (UTC): The administrator checked server monitoring systems, which showed that the Nginx process was not running.

10:15 AM (UTC): The administrator attempted to start the Nginx server manually but received an error message indicating a configuration issue.

10:20 AM (UTC): Investigations began by reviewing the Nginx configuration files for errors.

10:30 AM (UTC): While reviewing the configuration files, a typographical error in one of the configuration directives was discovered. The error was related to a misspelled file path.

10:45 AM (UTC): The team considered rolling back to a previous known good configuration, but it was ruled out as the typo was the only issue discovered.

11:00 AM (UTC): The Nginx configuration file was edited to correct the typographical error. The corrected configuration was then tested for syntax errors using the nginx -t command, which confirmed the configuration was now error-free.

11:15 AM (UTC): The Nginx server was successfully started after the configuration file was fixed.

12:00 PM (UTC): The web server was confirmed to be fully operational, and all hosted websites were accessible.

## Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths

During the investigation, the team briefly considered other potential issues, such as network problems and hardware failures. However, these paths were quickly ruled out as there were no corresponding alerts or indications of issues in these areas.

## Escalation

The incident was escalated to the system administrators and the DevOps team. They were involved in investigating and resolving the issue.

# Root cause and resolution

The root cause of the issue was the typographical error in the Nginx configuration file, specifically, a misspelled file path. This error prevented Nginx from starting correctly.

## Resolution:

The Nginx configuration file was edited to correct the typographical error.
The corrected configuration was tested for syntax errors using the nginx -t command, which confirmed the configuration was error-free.
The Nginx server was successfully started, restoring access to all hosted websites.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar incidents in the future and improve system reliability, the following measures will be implemented:

Regular Configuration Audits: Implement routine configuration audits to catch typographical errors and other misconfigurations early.

Automated Monitoring: Set up automated monitoring and alerts for critical services to detect and report service outages immediately.

Testing Staging Environments: Before applying changes to production configurations, test them in staging environments to catch errors before they impact live services.

Documentation: Maintain up-to-date documentation for server configurations to help administrators easily identify and fix issues.

## Tasks to Address the Issue

Implement automated configuration testing in the deployment pipeline.
Enhance documentation on server configurations and maintenance procedures.
Introduce a staging environment for configuration changes and updates.
Regularly review and audit Nginx and other critical service configurations for errors.
